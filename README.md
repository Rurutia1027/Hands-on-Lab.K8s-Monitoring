# Hands-on-Lab.K8S-in-Action 

**Master Kubernetes through practical hands-on labs using KinD on macOS.**

> Note: This lab is intended for developers who want to integrate Kubernetes into their daily work, not for those preparing CKA exams. 

## Overview 
This repo is designed for developers to **bridge the gap between local development and production Kubernetes clusters**. 

- Provides **hands-on**, **executable experiments** that are easy to run and verify. 
- Includes **clear**, **modular cases** to help developers get hands-on experience quickly and **flatten the leanring curve**. 
- Practice with **all main K8S components**: **Pods**, **Deployments**, **Services**, **ConfigMaps**, **Secrets**, **Volumes**, **Service Discovery**, **Jobs**, **RBAC**, and more. 
- Deploy **practical use cases in a local cluster** using KinD to emulate production-like environemnts. 

All labs are designed to make **learning by doing** simple and effective. 

> In addition, where appropriate, I will include microservice-based examples with runnable Jib-packaged code, because the goal is not only to master K8s itself, but also to support cloud-native development. These examples will demonstrate how to integrate microservices with different Kubernetes components, facilitate deployment, monitoring, testing, and CI/CD.
> Around each core component, the labs will try to closely reflect real production practices, including development, deployment, observability, and secondary development scenarios.

All labs are designed to make learning by doing simple and effective.

## Prerequisites
- macOS
- Docker
- KinD (brew install kind)
- kubectl CLI
- Optional: Jaeger and Grafana for monitoring and tracing


## Hands-On Topics 
### Core Kubernetes Components 
- Pods - basic execution units
- Deployments - declarative scaling and rolling updates 
- Services - stable networking for Pods 
- ConfigMaps & Secrets - configuraiton and sensitive data management
- Volumes - persistent storage or Pods 
- Service Discovery - DNS, ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer 
- Jobs & CronJobs - batch and scheduled tasks 
- RBAC - permissions and access control
